# UCSDUnfoldingMaps

This project was created as part of UCSD MOOC course task. It is fx apllication which uses unfolding library to create interactive map.
It markes positions of biggest cities, nucler stations and earthquakes for the last 2 weeks. When you click on city(station) marker it hides all other markers, except those earthquake markers, which distureb this city(station).   
Real-time data about earthqauke is delivered by U.S. Geological Survey web service in xml format. Cities and nuclear stations information is kept in json file.
For more legibility you can choose to display either city markers or station markers.

I express my gratitude to whole UCSD MOOC team for this engaging course and wish you all a good luck!
